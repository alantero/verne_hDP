## Plotting scripts

`PlotCorrectionFactors.py` - Plot correction factors (due to nuclear form factors) as a function of v (for a couple of example nuclei).

`PlotGamma_SUFpy`, `PlotGamma_MPI.py` - Plot gamma, the mean DM incidence angle for a given lab - either SUF, or MPI.

`PlotVelocityTransfer_CDMS.py`, `PlotVelocityTransfer_nucleus.py` - Plot the velocity transfer function (i.e. v\_final as a function of v\_initial), decomposed sequentially in terms of the atmosphere, the Earth and the shielding. Plot for either the CDMS experiment (at SUF) or the nucleus experiment (at MPI).

`PlotVelDists_gamma.py` - Plot the final speed distribution at the CDMS detector (SUF) as a function of the mean incoming DM direction. 

`PlotVelDists_xsec_CDMS.py`, `PlotVelDists_xsec_nucleus.py` - Plot the final speed distribution at the CDMS or nucleus detectors, as a function of DM-nucleon cross section.

`PlotConstraints.py` - Plot constraints on DM-nucleon scattering from nuclear-scattering experiments, including the updated constraints from the paper.

`PlotConstraints_all.py` - Plot constraints on DM-nucleon scattering from both direct and indirect probes.
